This is a demo application to test out the upload of files and images.

Criteria for success:
DONE: Mime type, extension checking for PDF and size limits on uploaded file - Done in the views, validators and models of the application.
DONE: Cleanup of files if the post referencing them is deleted.
DONE: Better success - getting the validator errors back to frontend. Don't re-instantaniate the form on save validation to get the errors.

Even better success - antivirus integration (clamav - later)

DONE: Image resize and checking for upload of image - Done on backend.


Full success - frontend check of file size before uploading.
